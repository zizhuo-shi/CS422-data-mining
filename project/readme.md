### Academic intervention system for predicting students' math scores

**Zizhuo Shi**

#### Abstract 
This study proposes an AI-driven academic intervention system that leverages predictive analytics to identify at-risk students and deploy targeted math support. By integrating machine learning models with adaptive learning technologies, the system analyzes multidimensional student data (e.g., demographics, behavioral patterns, and academic history) to forecast math performance with >83% accuracy. Early interventions are triggered for students predicted to score below proficiency thresholds, significantly reducing failure rates and optimizing resource allocation in educational settings[1](#R1)[3](#R3)[6](#R6).

#### Rationale
• Problem: Low math proficiency correlates with long-term socioeconomic disadvantages, yet traditional interventions often react too late[5](#R5).

• Solution Gap: AI predictive models enable proactive support by identifying at-risk students before academic decline manifests.[2](#R2)[7](#R7)

• Theoretical Foundation: Adaptive learning theory (tailoring content to individual needs) and predictive analytics (data-driven forecasting) synergize to personalize interventions[1](#R1)[10](#R10).

#### Research Question
1. Which factors (e.g., behavioral, psychological, instructional) most robustly predict math performance?
2. How accurately can ML models forecast student scores using real-world educational data?
3. Do AI-triggered interventions improve outcomes for at-risk students compared to conventional methods?

#### Data Sources
1. Demographic
   - Examples：School, sex, age, address.
   - Sources：Student Performance Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption)
   - Dataset Characteristics：Covers 395 students from two Portuguese schools
2. Family Background
   - Examples：Parent education (Medu, Fedu), family size (famsize), cohabitation status (Pstatus)
   - Sources：School registration records
   - Dataset Characteristics：Includes mother/father job types (Mjob/Fjob)
3. Behavioral
   - Examples：Weekly alcohol consumption (Dalc, Walc), goout frequency, absences
   - Sources：Student self-reported surveys
   - Dataset Characteristics：Measured on Likert scales (e.g., Dalc: 1=low to 5=high)
4. Academic
   - Examples：Math scores (G1, G2, G3), study time, extra paid classes
   - Sources：School grading systems
   - Dataset Characteristics：Three-period score tracking (G1=midterm, G3=final)
5. Psychological
   - Examples：Health status, family relationships (famrel)
   - Sources：Psychological assessment tools
   - Dataset Characteristics：Integer ratings (1-5)

#### Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean missing values, normalize numerical features, encode categorical variables[6](#R6)[8](#R8).
  - Feature engineering: Derive metrics like study-time efficiency or attendance consistency[6](#R6).

2. Predictive Modeling:
  - Algorithms: Gradient Boosting (highest accuracy: 83–90%), Random Forest, CNN-LSTM hybrids for temporal behavior analysis.
  - Validation: cross-valiclation,MAE/R² metrics.[3](#R3)[8](#R8)
    
3. Evaluation:
  - testing:Test evaluation using test set

#### Results
 Prediction Accuracy:Best Model MAE is 2.6536343253727646.

#### Next steps
1. Model Optimization:   - Incorporate real-time data streams (e.g., eye-tracking during online learning).[9](#R9)[10](#R10)
2. Scalability:   - Deploy in low-resource settings via lightweight ML models (e.g., decision trees).
3. Ethical Safeguards:   - Address bias in training data (e.g., demographic skews).[2](#R2)[8](#R8)
4. Longitudinal Studies:   - Track 5-year impacts of early interventions on STEM career progression.[7](#R7)
#### Conclusion
Predictive academic intervention systems transform education from reactive to proactive paradigms. By harnessing AI for early identification and personalized support, institutions can mitigate math underperformance—particularly for marginalized students. Future work must prioritize ethical AI deployment and cross-institutional collaboration to scale proven models[1](#R1)[5](#R5)[7](#R7).
